        <p>Beyond Your Game are soccer analytics experts, composed of  passionate team members with backgrounds in soccer and quantitative analysis. Equally important to the intense emotions that this sport can evoke in its fans, we believe that it remains a widely unexplored landscape by statistical enthusiasts who would be capable of bringing beneficial elements to what is already in place. Indeed, beyond the function of a very effective tool to analyze the game retrospectively, we believe that the data in soccer will serve a predictive purpose in the coming years along with the creation of new data and models that will be at the heart of our development.</p>
